# Microblog

This is a Flask-based microblogging application I’m building as part of my learning journey following [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Each version is tagged (v0.1, v0.2, ...) to track progress chapter by chapter.

## Setup (for later)

You’ll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
